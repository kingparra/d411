Overview
--------
This repository houses my notes and exercises
for Scripting and Automation - D411 at WGU,
which is a PowerShell course.

Code Organization
-----------------
In the ``task1`` and ``task2`` directories
you'll find my solutions to the performance
assesments.

The ``data`` directory contains data
that the tasks rely on from ``Requirements1.zip``.
